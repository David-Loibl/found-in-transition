# Clustering of transient snow line time series

We will cluster the transient snow line time series data in order to identify glaciers which show similar trends in the snow line altitudes through time.  Will use agglomerative hierarchical clustering, where we start with each time series in a separate cluster and then iteratively merge them. Pearson correlation will be used as a distance metric in order to cluster the profiles.
